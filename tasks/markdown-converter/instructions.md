# Markdown converter

The current function seperates paragraphs in markdown to seperate paragraphs in HTML while not creating empty paragraphs.

## Task for Person 1

Create and switch to a new branch named `implement-headings`:

```
git switch -c implement-headings
```

Adjust the function so that it convert lines that start with "#" signs followed by a space to their appropriate HTML headings. For more information, see [this markdown guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#headings). Unskip the tests that describe headings to test your implementation.

## Task for Person 2

Create and switch to a new branch named `implement-lists`:

```
git switch -c implement-lists
```

Adjust the function so that it converts lines that start with "-", "\*", or "+" followed by a space to an unordered list in HTML. For more information, see [this markdown guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#unordered-lists). Note that you are not requried to implement indented unordered lists. Unskip the tests that describe unordered lists to test your implementation.
